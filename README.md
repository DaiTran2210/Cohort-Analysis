# [PYTHON] Cohort Analysis: How to Check Out User Retention
## I. Introduction 
### 1. Cohort Analysis
So, what’s a cohort and why should you care? Well, a cohort is just a fancy term for a group of users who share a common characteristic, like signing up for your service at the same time. Cohort analysis helps you track how engaged these users are over time. It helps you figure out if people are really sticking around or if any increases in engagement are just because you got more users.
#### Three Major Types of Cohorts
* Time cohorts: Folks who signed up during a certain timeframe.

* Behavior cohorts: People who bought a product or subscribed at some point in the past.

* Size cohorts: Groups based on the size of customers buying the company’s products or services.
#### Which Cohort Type for This Project?
We're diving into Time Cohorts.

* We’ll break down users by the month they made their first purchase.

* Each purchase gets a cohort index showing how many months it’s been since that first transaction.
### 2. Business Questions
Using Python, we’ll dig into transaction data from KPMG to create a cohort. This will help stakeholders see how user engagement shapes up from their first transaction onward.

## II. Data Visualization with Python

## III. Insights
Customers who signed up and placed their first order in July 2017 are sticking around—retention rates hit up to 48.1% after 5 months.

April 2017 newbies are also pretty loyal, with rates like 45.1% at month 4, 42.1% at month 5, and 42.7% at month 7.

May 2021 starters show solid and stable retention too: 40.4% in month 2, 39% in month 3, and 41.3% in month 4.

Overall, mid-year recruits (around April to August) tend to be more stable and loyal compared to those who start in January and February—who just show average stability.

KPMG's yearly retention is good—over 30% most months (except 25.5% in the first month).

## IV. Recommendations
We should roll out some attractive deals for customers who join in the first months of the year to boost their retention over time.

Since mid-year months have higher retention rates, we need to dig into why that is (with relevant data and visualization) and see if we can apply those insights to other months.
